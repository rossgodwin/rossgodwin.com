Working as the representative from the civil engineering firm on this project, I worked closely with the developer to obtain the commercial site
plan approval from the city of Charlotte. This car wash was developed on a outparcel of the larger MoRA Point shopping mall complex. As the civil
project manager, I worked on this project from the pre-submittal meeting to the certificate of occupancy was obtained. One unique aspect of this
project was working closely with the car wash equipment provider (Carolina Pride) to ensure the reclaimation tanks worked in accordance with the
needs of the car wash system and the constraints of the existing sewer service. Challenges with this site includeded: unsuitble soils on site,
Charlotte tree save area, underground reclaim tank system, minimal sewer fall.
