If you are just interested in pictures, <a href="#pictures">here are before and after photos</a>.</p></section><section><h4>Background</h4><p> Shortly after starting employment with <a href="/construction/employment/bowman-civil-designer">Bowman (formerly Triangle Site Design)</a> I began poking around at the network and computer components. After investigation the IT infrastructure and using it on a daily basis it was evident that an upgrade was needed due to slow computer and network performance. it was evident that updates to workstations and network topology as well as cybersecurity measures were needed. There were also some security vulnerabilities that needed addressing.</p><p> I brought the issues that I found to the company owner's attention and initiated the idea of making some changes. He indicated to me that over the course of a few years in that current office location they had spent thousands of dollars with two different vendors and had trouble getting the infrastructure to where it currently was which was a functioning network but lacked in performance and expandability.</p><p> Here were some of the current conditions that I found:<ul class="rg-ul-marker-fa-chevron"><li> The closet containing the computer and networking equipment was a mess with components laying on the floor. You can see a picture below. This was unsightly, hard environment to work in and identify problems and put the network at risk should someone go in there, trip and break a critical component.<li> Download speeds were not close to reaching the 100Mbps that the company was paying for.<li> The office, located in a office park, was using shared internet access with several other businesses in surround office suites. Internet download speeds would slow as neighboring employees began arriving to work in the mornings and continue to degrade throughout the day as the load increased.<li> Desktop workstations were using wireless connectivity connecting to 2 UniFi AP-AC-Pro wireless access points which opened the door for bottlenecking and latency issues. Updating desktop wireless card drivers helped performance but was not a long-term fixed.<li> WAN access through a Cisco Meraki MX60 4 port router whose specifications indicated this device had a stateful firewall throughput of 100 Mbps and a advanced security throughput 50 Mbps. Another limiting factor was a recommended use case of 20 users. These were limiting factors should the company<li> Unshielded Cat5e ethernet cable running through walls to the wireless access points and printers.<li> The network topography did not lend itself to quick and easy expandability should the need arise, for instance if the company added employees (which it would in the future) or swith to IP phone service (which it would in the future)<li> Slow computers with inadequate hardware to keep up with the software used on a daily basis to perform required tasks.<li> Slow windows desktop station serving as the shared file server also running Carbonite for offsite backup. This machine did not have enough hardware resources to keep up with all that was required of it and it was central to daily business task.<li> No guest wireless network access, visiting clients were given full access to the company network.<li> No login protection on any of the workstations.</ul></p></section><section><h4>Met Goals</h4><p> After analyzing existing network limitations, research better network and hardware options, plan for future expandibility and consider cost. Here were some goals that I had in mind researching</p><p> <i> <b>Goal:</b> find a ISP that could provide reasonably priced dedicated internet access. </i><p> <a href="https://celito.net" target="_blank">Celito</a> is a local internet service provider that was looking to venture in to the office complex where we were located. We made the switch and have been extremely pleased with the dedicated fiber service that we receive and their wonderful customer support.</p></p><p> <i> <b>Goal:</b> transform the small closet that was a tangled mess of cables and equipment laying around on the floor in to a space that resembles a organized server room. </i><p> To get things off the floor and make working on the network easier, I decided to go with a wall mounted rack. I chose the <a href="https://www.startech.com/Server-Management/Racks/6U-14in-Deep-Wall-Mounting-Bracket-for-Patch-Panel~WALLMOUNT6" target="_blank">StarTech.com 6U wall mount network equipment rack</a>. This meant that any network components that I purchased from here out would need to be compatible with a 19 inch rack.</p></p><p> <i> <b>Goal:</b> replace existing router. </i><p> The router in use was a Cisco Meraki and based on my research in the specifications was not a good fit for our environment. I upgraded to the <a href="https://www.ui.com/unifi-routing/usg" target="_blank">UniFi Security Gateway</a> by Ubiquiti Networks.</p></p><p> <i> <b>Goal:</b> consolidate the two network switches in to one. There was an 8-port non-PoE switch sitting between the workstations and router and off of that was a 16-port PoE switch that was used to provide power and connectivity for the wireless access points. </i><p> I went with a <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/switches/110-series-unmanaged-switches/index.html" target="_blank">Cisco SG110 24-Port unmanaged PoE network switch</a>, which provides 12 PoE ports. Enough for the 2 wireless access points that are powered over the ethernet. And 12 non-PoE ports.</p></p><p> <i><b>Goal:</b> hardwire each office with ethernet cable so that workstations no longer depend on wireless connectivity.</i><p> To future proof the cable installation, I decided to go with Cat6a ethernet. I chose a product by <a href="https://www.monoprice.com/product?c_id=301&cp_id=30103&cs_id=3010303&p_id=18593&seq=1&format=2" target="_blank">Monoprice</a> that was rated F/UTP which wraps the 23AWG wire in a foil shield that acts as a barrier preventing interference and data signal leaks.</p><p> To organize the cable feeds coming in to the server closet from the offices, I went with a <a href="https://www.cablematters.com/pc-445-162-rackmount-or-wallmount-24-port-cat6a-shielded-rj45-patch-panel-with-jack-shutter.aspx" target="_blank">24-port Cable Matters rackmount Cat6a patch panel</a>. Outlets in the office would be provided by <a href="https://cat5ecableguy.com/inc/sdetail/238566" target="_blank">surface mount box</a>.</p></p><p> <i> <b>Goal:</b> upgrade the network storage access because of the volume of reads and writes required of it and because it's such a critical piece to the daily business operation. </i><p> Part of this would be to Free up the network storage server resources by offloading backup workload to a seperate dedicated workstation</p></p><p> <i> <b>Goal:</b> data redundancy, emergency failover option and office uptime during power flickers and outages. </i><p> For data backup, I chose not put this burden on the network storage device. Rather I took that workstation that served as the older file server and dedicated it to managing data backup.</p><p> For uptime during power flickers and outages, I made sure each employee workstation was equipped with a function UPS. For the network hardware I chose a rackmount power supply by <a href="https://www.cyberpowersystems.com/product/ups/smart-app-lcd/or500lcdrm1u/" target="_blank">CypberPower</a>.</p></p><p> <i> <b>Goal:</b> network folder space for each employee. </i><p> The main reason I wanted to set this up was for ease of employee information backup. Rather than having to maintain backup processes on each individual computer, I setup a personal network folder for them to use instead of the local C drive. The Linux based QTS kernel on the QNAP network access storage device provides nice management of users, folder resources and access privileges.</p></p><p> <i> <b>Goal:</b> provide new computers for employees also individual network storage </i><p> and thus automatic backing up</p></p></section><section><h4>Results</h4><p> I was very pleased with how everything turned out as was my boss and coworkers. The improvement in speed, latency and stability has been a drastic one. A lot of our traffic is internal so with the Gigabit network, hardwired workstations and new network storage,</p><p> Since performing this upgrade, the company has hired one additional full time employee and 2 summer interns. We have also made the switch to IP phones. Had these infrastructure changes not been made, supporting this additional load would have been interesting to say the least and probably made a negative impact on office productivity.</p><p> The power backup strategy worked well and has been tested a couple of times and worked great. Also the data backup strategy has really worked out well and has been a hands off solution.</p><p> With the employee network folders I no longer had to worry about how to backup data on each individual workstation and also requiring less hard drive space on individual desktops</p><p> One other thing that I'll mention is I installed the UniFi Controller service on the backup machine and has allowed me to perform monitoring and maintenance on the netork. This is a very nice interface</p></section><section><h4>Things I Would Do Different</h4><p> One thing I would do differently would be to run two ethernet cables to each office instead of just one. We also made the switch to IP phones and it would have been nice an additional line dedicated for the workstation and the other for the IP phone or a switch for multiple devices like an IP phone or laptop.</p></section><section> <h>Future Enhancements</h4>Setup Windows active directory</section><section> <a id="pictures"></a><h4>Pictures</h4><div id="thumbnail-demo"> <a href="/assets/images/gallery/tsd-office-it-infrastructure-overhaul/001.jpg" data-sub-html="This is a before photo of the network room.
